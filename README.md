Om-backend 🕉️🛒💻
Welcome to Om-backend! This repository hosts the backend services for an application, likely an e-commerce or content management system, given its routes for users, posts, and carts. Built with Node.js and Express.js, it provides a robust API for managing application data and handling user interactions.

✨ Features
User Management: Handles user registration, authentication, and profiles. 👤

Post Management: Supports creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of posts (e.g.product listings). 📝

Cart Functionality: Manages shopping cart operations for users. 🛒

MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB as the database with Mongoose for object data modeling. 🍃

CORS Enabled: Allows cross-origin requests for seamless frontend integration. 🔗

Environment Variable Configuration: Securely manages sensitive information like database credentials. 🛡️

Centralized Database Connection: Ensures consistent database connectivity. ⚡

🚀 Technologies Used
This project leverages a modern JavaScript stack to deliver a scalable and efficient backend:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment. ⚙️

Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. 🌐

MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database): For robust and scalable database hosting. ☁️

Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, simplifying database interactions. 🌿

dotenv: To load environment variables from a .env file. 🔑

cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. 🤝

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and run the Om-backend locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sid9879/Om-backend.git
cd Om-backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB Atlas connection details:

API_KEY=YOUR_MONGODB_USERNAME
API_PASSWORD=YOUR_MONGODB_PASSWORD
PORT=8090

Replace YOUR_MONGODB_USERNAME and YOUR_MONGODB_PASSWORD with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials. The PORT is optional if you want to change the default port.

Run the application:

node index.js

The server should now be running on http://localhost:8090 (or the port you specified in .env). You will see a "Connected to database online" message in your console if the database connection is successful.

📚 Project Structure
The project is organized into logical directories for maintainability and scalability:

./controllers: Contains the business logic and request handlers for different API routes.

./middleware: Houses custom Express middleware functions (e.g., authentication, error handling).

./models: Defines the Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections (e.g., User, Post, Cart).

./routes: Sets up the API endpoints and maps them to their respective controller functions.

./db.js: Handles the MongoDB database connection.

./index.js: The main entry point of the application, responsible for server setup, database connection, and route registration.

⚙️ API Endpoints
The backend exposes the following primary API routes:

/users: For user-related operations.

/posts: For managing application posts.

/carts: For handling shopping cart actions.

(Specific endpoints like GET /users, POST /users/register, GET /posts/:id, POST /carts/add would be defined within the respective route files.)
